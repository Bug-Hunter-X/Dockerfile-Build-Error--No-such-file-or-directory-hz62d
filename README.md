This repository demonstrates a common error when building Docker images: referencing files that are not present in the context of the Docker build.  The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`, but this file is missing. The corrected Dockerfile adds the file and ensures correct paths. This example uses Python, but the principle applies to other languages and build contexts.
